```shell
error: passing ‘const Question’ as ‘this’ argument discards qualifiers [-fpermissive]
```

I have a class `Cache` which has a function write specified as

```c++
bool write(const MemoryAccess &memory_access, CacheLine &cl);
```
I am calling this function like this.
```c++
const Cache *this_cache;
c = (a==b)?my_cache:not_cache;
c->write(memory_access,cl);
```
The above line is giving me following error
```shell
"passing ‘const Cache’ as ‘this’ argument of ‘bool Cache::write(const MemoryAccess&, CacheLine&)’ discards qualifiers [-fpermissive]."
```


# 2. 解决方案
Since `c` is of type `const Cache *`, you can only call const member functions on it.

You have two options:

1. remove const from the declaration of c;
2. change Cache::write() like so:
    ```c++
    bool write(const MemoryAccess &memory_access, CacheLine &cl) const;
    ```
