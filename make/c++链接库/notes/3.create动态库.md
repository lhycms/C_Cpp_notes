# 0. 前言
<font color="orange" size="4">

1. When a C program is compiled, the compiler generates `object code`. 
2. After generating `object code`, the compiler also invokes linker. -- Make code of library functions (e.g. `printf()`, `scanf()`, `sqrt()`, ...etc) available to your program. A linker accomplish this task in two ways:
    - Copying the code of library function to your object code
    - Making some arrangement so that the complete code of library functions is not copied, but made available at run-time.
3. When you have a reusable set of functions, it is helpful to build a library from it so that you do not have to copy the source code into your current project and recompile it all the time.

# 1. Rundown from source code to program
<font color="orange" size="4">

1. `C Preprocessor`
2. `Compilation`
3. `Linking`: Here is where all of the object files and any libraries are linked together to make your final program.
4. `Loading`: This stage happens when your program starts up -- Your program is scanned for references to shared libraries.

</font>


# 2. Generate Dynamic(Shared) Library (生成动态链接库)

## 2.1. Shared Library 的使用方法

 - 见 2.2. Demo 1

</font>

## 2.2. Demo 1: Shared Library 的使用
### 2.2.1 Step 1: `Header file`, `Code file`, `main file`
<font color="orange" size="4">

1. `foo.h`: Defines the interface to our library.
2. `foo.cpp`: Contains the implementation of function.
3. `main.cpp`: Driver program that uses our library.

</font>

```c++
/* Filename: foo.h */
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H

extern void foo(void);

#endif
```

```c++
/* Filename: foo.cpp */
#include <iostream>

void foo(void) {
    std::cout << "Hello, I am a shared library.\n";
}
```

```c++
/* Filename: main.cpp */
#include <iostream>
#include "foo.h"

int main() {
    std::cout << "This is a shared library test...\n";
    foo();
    return 0;
}
```

### 2.2.2. Step 2: Compiling with `Position Independent Code`
```shell
linux > g++ -Wall -fpic -c foo.cpp -o foo.o
```

### 2.2.3 Step 3: Creating a `Shared Library` from an object file
```shell
linux > g++ -shared foo.o -o libfoo.so
```

### 2.2.4 Step 4: Linking with a `shared library`
```shell
linux > g++ -Wall main.c -L. -lfoo -o main
```
<font color="red" size="4">

Note
----
The linker does not know where to find libfoo. `GCC has a list of places it looks by default`, but our directory is not in that list.2 We need to tell GCC where to find libfoo.so. We will do that with the `-L option`. In this example, we will use the current directory, /home/username/foo:

```shell
linux > g++ -Wall main.c -L/home/username/foo -lfoo -o main
```

</font>

### 2.2.5 Making the library available at runtime 
```shell
linux >$ ./test
./test: error while loading shared libraries: libfoo.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

<font color="red" size="4">

Note
----
1. Oh no! `The loader cannot find the shared library`. We did not install it in a `standard location`, so we need to give the loader a little help. We have a couple of options: 
   1. we can use the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for this
   2. `-rpath` option

</font>


#### 2.2.5.1 `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
```linux 
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/username/foo:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ ./test
This is a shared library test...
Hello, I am a shared library
```

#### 2.2.5.2 `-rpath` option
- When linking libraries, `-rpath` is used to pass the address of dynamic libraries to ld.
- The `-Wl portion` sends comma-separated options to the linker, so we tell it to send the -rpath option to the linker.


```linux 
$ unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ g++ -L/home/username/foo -Wl,-rpath=/home/username/foo -Wall -o test main.c -lfoo
$ ./test
This is a shared library test...
Hello, I am a shared library
```


# 3. `-rpath` vs. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
<font color="orange" size="4">

- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` 比 `-rpath` 更好

</font>


# 4. Using `ldconfig command` to modify `ld.so file`
<font color="gree" size="4">

1. This part is to install our custom `shared library` on the system so everybody can use it. 
2. You need to do two things:
    1. Put the library in standard location. Probably `/usr/lib` or `/usr/local/lib`
    2. Modify 'ld.so' config file and cache.

</font>

## 4.1. Step 1.
```shell
$ cp /home/username/foo/libfoo.so /usr/lib
$ chmod 0755 /usr/lib/libfoo.so
```

## 4.2. Step 2.
Now the file is in a standard location, with correct permissions, readable by everybody. We need to `tell the loader it is available for use, so let us update the cache`:

```shell
$ ldconfig
```

## 4.3. Step 3.
That should create a link to our shared library and update the cache so it is available for immediate use. Let us double check:

```shell
$ $ ldconfig -p | grep foo
libfoo.so (libc6) => /usr/lib/libfoo.so 
```
