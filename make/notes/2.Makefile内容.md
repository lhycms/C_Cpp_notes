# 1. Including Other Makefiles
<font color="orange" size="4">

1. The `include` directive tells `make` 
    - Suspend reading the current makefile
    - Read one or more than makefiles before continuing
```Makefile
include <filename_1> <filename_2> ...

# e.g.
bar = e.mk f.mk
include *.mk $(bar) # include foo a.mk b.mk c.mk e.mk f.mk
```
