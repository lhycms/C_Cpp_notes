# Targets


# 1. The all target -- `all` 
<font color="gree" size="4">

Making `multiple targets` and you want all of them to run? Make an `all` target.

</font>

```Makefile
all: one two three

one:
    touch one
two:
    touch two
three:
    touch three

.PHONY: clean
clean:
    rm -r one two three
```


# 2. Multiple targets -- `$@`
<font color="gree" size="4">

When there are multiple targets for a rule, the commands will be run for each target `$@` `is an automatic variable that contains the target name.`

</font>

```Makefile
all: f1.o f2.o

f1.o f2.o:
	echo $@
# Equivalent to:
# f1.o:
#	 echo f1.o
# f2.o:
#	 echo f2.o
```
