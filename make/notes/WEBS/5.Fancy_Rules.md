# 1. Implicit Rules

## 1.1. Here's a list of `implicit rules`
<font color="orange" size="4">

- Compiling a C program: n.o is made automatically from n.c with a command of the form `$(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CFLAGS)`
- Compiling a C++ program: n.o is made automatically from n.cc or n.cpp with a command of the form `$(CXX) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS)`
- Linking a single object file: n is made automatically from n.o by running the command `$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) n.o $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS)`

</font>

## 1.2. The important `variables` used by `implicit rules`
<font color="gree" size="4">

- `CC`: Program for compiling C programs; default `cc`
- `CXX`: Program for compiling C++ programs; default `g++`
- `CFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to the `C compiler`
- `CXXFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to the `C++ compiler`
- `CPPFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to the `C preprocessor`
- `LDFLAGS`: Extra flags to give to compilers when they are supposed to invoke the `linker`
- `blah: blah.o`: `C linker implicit rule`
- `blah.o: blah.c`: `C compilation implicit rule`, because blah.c exists

</font>

Let's see how we can now build a C program without ever explicitly telling Make how to do the compililation:

```Makefile
CXX = g++ # Flag for implicit rules
CXXFLAGS = -g # Flag for implicit rules. Turn on debug info

# Implicit rule #1: blah is built via the `C linker implicit rule`
# Implicit rule #2: blah.o is built via the `C compilation implicit rule`, because blah.c exists
blah: blah.o
blah.o: blah.c

clean:
	rm -f *.o
```

# 2. Static Pattern Rules
Static pattern rules are another way to write less in a Makefile, but I'd say are more useful and a bit less "magic". Here's their syntax:
