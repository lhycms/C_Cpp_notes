# 1. `*` Wildcard
<font color="gree" size="4">

- Both `*` and `%` are called wildcards in Make, but they mean entirely different things. `*` searches your filesystem for matching filenames. I suggest that you always `wrap it in the wildcard function -- $(wildcard *.c)`, because otherwise you may fall into a common pitfall described below.

</font>

```Makefile
# Print out file information about every .c file
print: $(wildcard *.c)
	ls -la  $?
```

## 1.1. 注意事项
<font color="gree" size="4">

`*` may be used in the `target, prerequisites, or in the wildcard function.`

- Danger: `*` may not be directly used in a variable definitions

- Danger: When `*` matches no files, it is left as it is (unless run in the wildcard function)

</font>

```Makefile
thing_wrong := *.o # Don't do this! '*' will not get expanded
thing_right := $(wildcard *.o)

all: one two three four

# Fails, because $(thing_wrong) is the string "*.o"
one: $(thing_wrong)

# Stays as *.o if there are no files that match this pattern :(
two: *.o 

# Works as you would expect! In this case, it does nothing.
three: $(thing_right)

# Same as rule three
four: $(wildcard *.o)
```

# 2. `%` Wildcard
<font color="gree" size="4">

1. `%` is really useful, but is somewhat confusing because of the variety of situations it can be used in.

    1. When used in `"matching" mode`, it matches one or more characters in a string. This match is called the stem.
    2. When used in `"replacing" mode`, it takes the stem that was matched and replaces that in a string.
    3. `%` is most often used in rule definitions and in some specific functions.

1. See these sections on examples of it being used:
- `Static Pattern Rules`
- `Pattern Rules`
- `String Substitution`
- `The vpath Directive`

</font>

# 3. Automatic Variables

## 3.1. `Prerequisite`
<font color="gree" size="4">

1. `$?`: 比目标新的所有先决条件的名称，它们之间有空格。 如果目标不存在，则将包括所有先决条件。
2. `$^`: The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.
3. `$<`: The name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its recipe from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the implicit rule

</font>

## 3.2. `Target`
<font color="gree" size="4">

If the target is `foo.a(bar.o)` then `$%` is bar.o and `$@` is foo.a. `$%` is `empty` when the target is not an archive member.

1. `$@`: The file name of the target of the rule. If the target is an archive member, then `$@` is the name of the `archive file`.
2. `$%`: The target member name, when the target is an archive member.

</font>

# 4. Archive Files
<font color="orange" size="4">

`Archive files` are files containing named sub-files called `members`; they are maintained with the program ar and their main use is as <font color="red" size="4">subroutine libraries</font> for linking.

1. `Archive Members`: Archive members as targets.
2. `Archive Update`: The implicit rule for archive member targets.
3. `Archive Pitfalls`: Dangers to watch out for when using archives.
4. `Archive Suffix Rules`: You can write a special kind of suffix rule for updating archives.

</font>

## 4.1. Archive members(静态库) as targets
An individual member of achieve file can be used as a target or prerequisite in `make`. You specify the memeber named `member` in archieve file as follows:
```Makefile
# This construct is available only in prerequisites and targets, not in recipes
archieve(member)
```

Only `ar` and other programs designed to operate on `archieve`. For example, this rule says to create a member `hack.o` in archive foolib by copying the file `hack.o`:
```Makefile
# The way to update achieve member targets.
libfoo.a(hack.o) : hack.o
    ar cr libfoo.a hack.o
```

To specify several members in the same archive, you can write all the member names together between the parentheses. For example:
```Makefile 
# Way 1
libfoo.a(hack.o kludge.o)
# Way 2
libfoo.a(*.o)
```

# 5. `Subroutines`
<font color="orange" size="4">

1. `Subroutines` are stored in `libraries`:
    1. Conserve the storage.
    2. Make program linkage process more efficiently.
2. A `library` is a data file that contains copies of a number of individual files and control information that allows them to be accessed individually.
   1. The libraries are located in the `/usr/lib ... ` directories. 
   2. By convention, most of them have names of the form `libname.a`.

</font>

## 5.1. Demo 1. 指定 `Archive file` 的 `member`

### 5.1.1. `Source code`
```c++
/* Filename: function.h */
#ifndef FUNCTION_H
#define FUNCTION_H

float add(float&, float&);
float substract(float&, float&);

#endif
```

```c++
/* Filename: add.cpp */
#include "add.h"

float add(float &value1, float &value2) {
    return value1 + value2;
}
```

```c++
/* Filename: substract.cpp */
#include "substract.h"

float substract(float &value1, float &value2) {
    return value1 - value2;
}
```

```c++
/* Filename: main.cpp */
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "function.h"


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    float value1 = std::atof(argv[1]);
    float value2 = std::atof(argv[2]);
    std::cout << add(value1, value2) << std::endl;
    std::cout << substract(value1, value2) << std::endl;
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### 5.1.2. `Makefile`
```Makefile
all : main

main : main.o libfunction.a(add.o substract.o)
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.o -L. -lfunction -o main

libfunction.a(add.o substract.o) : add.o substract.o
	ar rcs libfunction.a add.o substract.o

add.o : add.cpp
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c add.cpp -o add.o

substract.o : substract.cpp
	g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -c substract.cpp -o substract.o

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -r *.o *.a main
```
