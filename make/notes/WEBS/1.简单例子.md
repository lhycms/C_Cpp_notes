# 1. Running the Examples - A simplest `Makefile`
```Makefile
hello: 
    echo "hello world"
```
Here is the output of running the above example:
```shell
$ make
echo "Hello world."
Hello world.
```


# 2. `Makefile` Syntax
<font color="gree" size="4">

A `Makefile` consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:

</font>

```Makefile
targets: prerequisites
    command_1
    command_2
    command_3
```

<font color="gree" size="4">

Context
-------
1. The `targets` are `file names`, separated by `spaces`. Typically, there is only one per rule.
2. The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to `start with a tab character, not spaces.`
3. The `prerequisites` are also `file names`, separated by `spaces`. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called `dependencies`

</font>


# 3. Beginner Examples

## 3.1. Demo 1
<font color="gree" size="4">

The following `Makefile` has three seperate rules. When you run `make blah` in terminal, it will build a program called `blah` in a series of steps:
1. `make` is given `blah` as the target, so it first searches for this target
2. `blah` requires `blah.o`, so make searches for the `blah.o` target
3. `blah.o` requires `blah.c`, so make searches for the `blah.c` target
4. `blah.c` has no dependencies, so the echo command is run
5. The `cc -c` command is then run, because all of the `blah.o` dependencies are finished
6. The top `cc` command is run, because all the `blah` dependencies are finished
7. That's it: `blah` is a compiled c program

</font>

```Makefile
blah: blah.o
	cc blah.o -o blah # Runs third

blah.o: blah.c
	cc -c blah.c -o blah.o # Runs second

blah.c:
	echo "int main() { return 0; }" > blah.c # Runs first
```

## 3.2. Demo 2
<font color="gree" size="4">

- This `Makefile` has a single target, called `some_file`. The default target is the first target, so in this case `some_file` will run.

</font>

```Makefile
some_file:
    echo "This line will always print."
```

## 3.3. Demo 3
<font color="gree" size="4">

- This file will make `some_file` the first time, and the second time notice it's already made, resulting in make: `'some_file' is up to date.`

</font>

```Makefile
some_file:
    echo "This line will always print."
    touch some_file
```

## 3.4. Demo 4
<font color="gree" size="4">

- Here, the target `some_file` "depends" on `other_file`. When we run `make`, the `default target (some_file, since it's first)` will get called. It will first look at its list of dependencies, and if any of them are older, it will first run the targets for those dependencies, and then run itself. `The second time this is run, neither target will run because both targets exist.`

</font>

```Makefile
some_file: other_file
    echo "This will run second, because it depends on other_file"

other_file: 
    echo "This will run first"
    touch other_file
```

## 3.5. Demo 5
<font color="gree" size="4">

- This will always run both targets, because some_file depends on other_file, which is never created.

</font>

```Makefile
some_file: other_file
	touch some_file

other_file:
	echo "nothing"
```

## 3.6. `clean`: Removes the output of targets
<font color="gree" size="4">

- `clean` is often used as a target that removes the output of other targets, but it is not a special word in make.

</font>

```Makefile
some_file: 
	touch some_file

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -f some_file
```
